# Login Page: Password + OTP-Based Login üîê‚ú®

Welcome to the **Login Page** repository, where we integrate both **traditional password-based login** and **OTP-based login** into a seamless and secure authentication solution. Empower your users with the flexibility to log in their way!

## üí° Why Password + OTP-Based Login?

- **User-Friendly Options:** 
  - Traditionalists can use passwords.
  - Modernists can opt for OTP (One-Time Password) login.
  
- **Secure Authentication:**
  - The `is_verified` column ensures that only verified users gain access.
  - OTPs are time-sensitive (`otp_expiry`) to prevent multiple use or abuse.

By supporting both methods, our system enhances **user experience** while ensuring **robust security**.
