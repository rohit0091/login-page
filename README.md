# Login Page: Password + OTP-Based Login 🔐✨

Welcome to the **Login Page** repository, where we integrate both traditional password-based login and OTP-based login into a seamless and secure authentication solution. Empower your users with the flexibility to log in their way!

---

## 💡 Why Password + OTP-Based Login?

- **User-Friendly Options:**
  - Traditionalists can use passwords.
  - Modernists can opt for OTP (One-Time Password) login.
  
- **Secure Authentication:**
  - The `is_verified` column ensures that only verified users gain access.
  - OTPs are time-sensitive (`otp_expiry`) to prevent multiple use or abuse.

By supporting both methods, our system enhances **user experience** while ensuring **robust security**.

## 📌 Features

- 🔒 **Password-Based Login:** Users log in with their email and password.
- 📱 **OTP-Based Login:** Users log in by receiving a unique OTP via email.
- 🛡️ **Verification System:** Only verified users can log in.
- 🕒 **OTP Expiry Mechanism:** Expired OTPs become invalid for added security.
- 💾 **Backend with Node.js & MySQL:** Efficient handling of authentication logic.
- 🌐 **Frontend with React.js:** Intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## 🛠️ How It Works (Login Flow)

### 👉 **Step 1: User Chooses Login Method**
- On the login page, users see:
  - **"Login with Password"** or **"Login with OTP"**.

### 👉 **Step 2A: Password-Based Login**
1. Users enter their **email** and **password**.
2. The system verifies their password.
3. If correct, they are logged in.

### 👉 **Step 2B: OTP-Based Login**
1. Users enter their **email**.
2. The system sends an OTP to their registered email.
3. Users input the OTP.
4. If the OTP matches and hasn’t expired, they are logged in.

## 🎯 Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Traditional Login (Password)**
- **User:** Registers with `email = john@example.com` and `password = "John@123"`.
- **Login:** Inputs email and password to log in.
- **Best For:** Users who prefer remembering their passwords.

### **Scenario 2: OTP-Based Login**
- **User:** Registers with `email = mike@example.com` (without a password).
- **Login:** Inputs email and receives an OTP (e.g., `345678`) via email.
- **OTP Validation:** Enters the OTP to log in.
- **Best For:** Users who prefer password-free authentication.

## 🏗️ Technologies Used

### 🔹 **Backend**
- **Node.js:** Handles API requests and authentication logic.
- **MySQL:** Stores user data, passwords (hashed), OTPs, and verification details.

### 🔹 **Frontend**
- **React.js:** Provides a dynamic, responsive login page interface.

### 🔹 **Additional Tools**
- **bcrypt:** For securely hashing passwords.
- **nodemailer:** To send OTPs via email.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For session management and authentication.
